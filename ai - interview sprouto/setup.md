### Introduction
Tell about Sprouto, his active development surrounding Supreme Commander, the LOUD project and his role in that project.

### Down to the basics

#### Can you describe what an AI is within the context of Supreme Commander?
The idea of this question is to create a basic but fundamental understanding to what an AI is: it is not math magic like a neural network, it is an extensive list of (complicated) if statements. Ideally this should be answer with an example with possible footage of that example.

#### People wonder why an AI can't be good at everything at once - why is that?
The idea here is to show why an AI can be good at 1v1 on a 10x10 map, but then performs poorly in 1v1 on a 20x20 map.

#### Can an AI have a global strategy?
The idea is to answer whether an AI has some idea of what it is doing, some goal.

#### What are markers to an AI?
A nice reference to the tutorials :) 

### Diving deeper

#### If you could add new markers, what would they be and why?
This can be anything really, go as in-depth as you'd like. Would like to know in advance what it is that you wish to discuss such that we can add in questions to prepare for this question. Is optional.

#### What are the limitations for an AI within the context of Supreme Commander?
The idea is to answer the question why an AI will generally never beat a top-notch player without having an unrealistic advantage such as 2x eco.

#### If you could change something to the engine of Supreme Commander, what would it be and why?
This can be anything really, go as in-depth as you'd like. Would like to know in advance what it is that you wish to discuss such that we can add in questions to prepare for this question. Is optional.

#### You're the Great Gazoo of LOUD - what is LOUD to you?
Here we dive deeper into LOUD and what it is to you.

#### What will LOUD be in the future?
And what you want it to become in the end.

#### People have asked why LOUD cannot be integrated into FAF - can you give your view on it?
I know this isn't realistic, but hearing it from you is good.
