### Learning LUA

When you have no experience with any programming language then learning LUA in the context of Supreme Commander is a daunting task. Therefore I advice you to learn the foundations of programming outside the context of Supreme Commander, while using the source code of Supreme Commander as a test to see if your understanding of reading (and writing) code is improved. 

**Learning LUA with the book 'Programming with LUA'**

 - https://dcc.ufrj.br/~fabiom/lua/

The first link is the official book for learning LUA. This is the first edition which is free. Later editions may have more examples and error corrections, luckily this edition is great on its own. The second link is a course that works with the book and provides additional information and another perspective on the concepts.

**Learning LUA at Tutorial Point**

It covers all the essentials up to some more difficult topics such as metatables. It starts off with the setup of your development environment. 

**Learning LUA on Youtube**
 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iU1pCgmjx4&list=PLxgtJR7f0RBKGid7F2dfv7qc-xWwSee2O

A tutorial series that covers the basic concepts of LUA. The source is fine and I added it to this list with the purpose to help people that learn more with videos.

Regardless of what approach you take to learn the basic steps: always look back at to the code in Supreme Commander after a few parts of learning. As an example: after learning about variables and loops you'll start recognizing the structure of the code in Supreme Commander scripts. Speaking off, let's see how where we can find the scripts that are part of the game.
