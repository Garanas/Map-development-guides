The majority of the game is written in LUA scripts. These scripts determine almost all the behavior of the game: from UI interaction to developing mods and scripted maps. At the moment of writing there are a few guides out there to help you out with learning how to write scripts. This introduction will assist in this by linking to various sources and explaining how you can prepare the game to make development as easy as possible.

#### Original scripts
You can find all the original scripts of the game inside the gamedata folder. They can be found in the following files:

For the original game:
_%to-steam%\steam\steamapps\common\supreme commander\gamedata\lua.scd_
_%to-steam%\steam\steamapps\common\supreme commander\gamedata\mohodata.scd_
_%to-steam%\steam\steamapps\common\supreme commander\gamedata\schook.scd_

For Forged Alliance:
_%to-steam%\steam\steamapps\common\supreme commander forged alliance\gamedata\lua.scd_
_%to-steam%\steam\steamapps\common\supreme commander forged alliance\gamedata\mohodata.scd_
_%to-steam%\steam\steamapps\common\supreme commander forged alliance\gamedata\schook.scd_

These files are zip files with a different extension. You can copy them, move the copy to your development environment, change their extension from '.scd' to '.zip' and then use any zip extracting software to extract all the information.
